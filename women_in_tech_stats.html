          <p class="mb-0">Employers can only interview and recruit what is in front of them. Tech employers advertise
            the majority of their roles. Look at any tech job that's advertised and you will see the majority of
            companies have a diversity statement stating clearly they don't discriminate on any grounds, including
            gender and they actively encourage applications from women.

          <p>To dissect the problem, we need to look at early development. In high school, girls achieve better grades
            than boys. Yet for girls who do pursue computer science at university level, they find themselves being
            outnumbered by males “52% vs 30% “ one of the highest gender disparities in course subjects. And this
            imbalance isn't helped by the falling trend of females taking up science, maths and computing courses.

          <!-- Women in tech paragraph -->
          <p>There is a current narrative that there are no women in tech to look up to, and a misconception that women
            don't succeed in tech. This is not true and if anything, this narrative is damaging and hurting women before
            they even get started. Below is a list of women who have not only succeeded in tech, but have reached the
            absolute pinnacle and are either currently, or have recently headed up billion-dollar multinational
            organisations.

          <p>Gemma Church from women in tech wrote recently <cite>“Tech is probably the only field that allows you to
              work on anything from anywhere”</cite></p>
          <p>Standard benefits that you can expect with most tech companies are:</p>
          <!-- Ordered list of benefits -->
          <ol class="mb-3">
            <li>Work from home and hybrid working environments</li>
            <li>Flexible hours, not glued to a desk from 9am until 5pm</li>
            <li>The majority of tech companies offer maternity & paternity leave on full pay</li>
            <li>Private medical health insurance</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Rather than write a whole list about how rewarding a career in tech can be for women, why don't you watch
            the short videos below and hear directly from women who are already working in tech.</p>
